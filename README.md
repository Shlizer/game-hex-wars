# Hex Wars

## Description

It's my test project on making JS desktop game. Basically im using React for UI (first time with Typescript so it can be clunky), Electron for app features and Canvas for rendering. It'll be basically simple hex-based strategy game =)\
This technology isn't for this kind of stuff, but it's fastest way to do something that can be called 'game' and it won't be another snake or tick-tack-toe =p

## Game mechanics

All game mechanics and basic info about project are stored in [**docs**](docs/index.md) folder.

## Usage

For now I only mostly use dev mode (so production build can sometimes got errors), so just clone, get npm/yarn to install dependencies and go for `yarn dev`.
Tested on Win8.1, Win10 and Ubuntu18, but it should also run on Mac's.
